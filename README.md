Hackathon
=========

This is the codebase for our not yet accepted Koding Hackathon team. Please keep on top of GitHub issues which require attention, we need to be organized.

### IRC
We now have an IRC channel. It is at **#teamshog** on **irc.freenode.net**. There is a robot (hubot) called chiphog who will be able to make your life that much better, but he will hog all the chips.
