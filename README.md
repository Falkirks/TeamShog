Hackathon [![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/Falkirks/Hackathon.svg?token=4QK2uxFbcdYPyhixDggt&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/Falkirks/Hackathon)
=========

This is the codebase for our Koding Hackathon team. Please keep on top of GitHub issues which require attention, we need to be organized.

### IRC
We now have a private IRC channel. It is at **#teamshog** on **irc.freenode.net**. There is a robot (hubot) called chiphog who will make your life that much better, but he will hog all the chips. **If you can't join you will need to create an issue requesting your IRC username is invited.**

### Automatic Deployment
Code will be automatically deployed to a public Heroku instance when the Travis CI build passes.
